#Codebreaking for Traditional Cipher Systems

*Information theory provides general insights about the security of various encryption schemes. However, cracking an "insecure" cipher often requires a lot of clever probabilistic inference, for instance in the form of sampling schemes like Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution over encryption keys.

*Historically, cracking the German Enigma encryption machine was such a task, you can read about it in Section 18.4 of [MacKay]. More recently, Kevin Knight and colleagues has also written a number of papers on codebreaking from an explicitly Bayesian viewpoint (e.g., this one).

*If you like a programming challenge, you can also try to decipher the encrypted texts listed under this topic on Mathias' page and report on your findings.
